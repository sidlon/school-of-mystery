# School of Mystery: a Fixie.ai Game

This repo contains an example of how to use the Fixie.ai platform to create a classic-style text adventure in any environment that you can describe.

The game is playable at: [https://app.fixie.ai/agents/sidlon/school_of_mystery_game](https://app.fixie.ai/agents/sidlon/school_of_mystery_game)

You can make changes and deploy new games under your own Fixie account.

Full docs on the Fixie platform can be found at: [https://docs.fixie.ai/](https://docs.fixie.ai/).

## Installing the Fixie CLI
You'll need to install the Fixie CLI to run these examples. You'll need Python >= 3.9 installed.

Install the Fixie CLI with `pip install fixieai`. Once installed, run `fixie auth` to authenticate to the Fixie service. If you don't already have an account, you'll need to create one at app.fixie.ai.

## Deploying this game
Run: `fixie agent deploy`

After a successful deployment, you can see and interact with your agent at [the Fixie website](https://app.fixie.ai).
